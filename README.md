A very simple C# Windows Form application that many staff firms ask to see submitted with the resume.

Well I made the simple program with a twist. Catch the button if you can! It will laugh at you if you canâ€™t. And if you do catch it, it will show a Message Box that says the Hello World message and then give the user an option to do a party where cats dance. LOL.
